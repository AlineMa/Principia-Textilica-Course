Working with IntelliJ
=====================

# IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ is an open source IDE (integrated development environment) for writing code.
It was originally developed for coding in *Java*.
But there are powerful Plugins for *Processing*, and *Mathematica* too.

It also plays nicely with *git* and *github* which makes it an excellent tool for collaborative computational craft.

## Getting Started

* Install IntelliJ on your local machine

## Github Plugin

IntelliJ features [Github Integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/using-github-integration.html).

* Make sure the Github Plugin is enabled. (`Settings > Plugins`)
