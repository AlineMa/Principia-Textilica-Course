Braiding with *Processing*
==========================

## Things to Try

### Coding Braids

* Play with the braiding example
* Write your own little braiding programs
* Make screenshots of your results and post them
   
### Coding for Braids

* Get a collection of strands
* Make photos of your strands
* Modify the preview to account for the material properties of your braids 
* Make screenshots of the preview and the braided result

### Algorithmic Braids

* Pick a sorting algorithm of your choice
* Implement it in Processing
* Use the steps of the algorithm to cotrol the braiding sequence
* Make screenshots of braids starting with various initial conditions <br>
  (random sequece, reverse order ...)
* Try to create a braid based on those instructions
* Document the results
